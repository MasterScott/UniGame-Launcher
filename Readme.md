### UniGame Launcher

Universal launcher for games, to be placed in game folder. I would say it's best to rename it to something like *_Game Name.exe*, so that it's the first file you see there. It includes two versions:

- *one* - to be used with games that have only 32bit or 64bit executables
- *two* - to be used with games that have both 32bit and 64bit executables

------

**Features:**

- runs as administrator only at first launch
- can run game executable with arguments and / or compatibility settings

- can run game executable on the first cpu core, thanks to included [RunFirst.exe](https://www.activeplus.com/products/runfirst) - to be used only on some older games that don't run properly on multi-core cpus
- if savegame folder is specified, creates a *_savegame.lnk* shortcut to it
